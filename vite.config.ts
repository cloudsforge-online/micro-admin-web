/**
 * There is deliberately no `define`, no `envPrefix` and no `.env` file in this repository.
 *
 * A build-time constant is an environment baked into an image, and an image with an environment
 * baked into it has to be rebuilt to be promoted — which means the artefact that reaches
 * production is not the artefact that passed CI. Every host this console talks to is resolved at
 * RUNTIME from `window.location.hostname` by `cloudsforgeHosts()`, so one image serves localhost,
 * staging, a preview deployment and production. `test/no-build-time-config.test.ts` fails the
 * build if `import.meta.env.VITE_` ever reappears, and the `rules` job in CI greps for it again
 * so deleting the test does not delete the rule.
